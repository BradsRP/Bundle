Description Thank you, with this navigation system we can finally get the coordinated of the DMZ Level 3. However be careful, we don't know what we'll encounter and our tools are telling us that there are high levels of radiation. From what we can see from a distance though, there is a radio tower. Head over there and see if you can find any radio logs or anything that may be useful to us.
