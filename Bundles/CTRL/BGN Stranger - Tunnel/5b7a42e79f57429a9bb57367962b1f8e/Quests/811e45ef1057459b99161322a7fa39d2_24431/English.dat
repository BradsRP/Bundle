Description From what we can see after doing some scouting with our UAV drone, there is a hidden militia camp on the hill in the DMZ Level 3. Head over there and see if you can find any ordinary or even special weapons and bring them back to me. The Illegal Gun Dealer is really interested in them and mentioned that he will make it worth your time.
